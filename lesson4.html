    <h1>Lesson 4: The Power of Compound Interest</h1>

        <h2>What is Compound Interest?</h2>
        <p>Compound interest is often called "interest on interest." It's the process where you earn returns not just on your initial investment, but also on the accumulated interest over time. This creates a snowball effect, potentially leading to exponential growth of your money.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>How Compound Interest Works</h2>
        <p>Let's break it down with a simple example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You invest $1,000 at a 5% annual interest rate.</li>
            <li>After the first year, you earn $50 in interest (5% of $1,000).</li>
            <li>In the second year, you earn interest on $1,050 (your original $1,000 plus the $50 interest).</li>
            <li>This process continues, with your balance growing faster each year.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>The Magic of Time</h2>
        <p>Compound interest becomes truly powerful over long periods. The longer you allow your money to grow, the more dramatic the effects become.</p>
        <p>Consider two scenarios:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Person 1 invests $5,000 at age 25 and leaves it until retirement at 65.</li>
            <li>Person 2 invests $5,000 at age 45 and leaves it until retirement at 65.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Assuming an 8% annual return, compounded annually:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Person 1's investment grows to about $108,623</li>
            <li>Person 2's investment grows to only $23,304</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This demonstrates the importance of starting early!</p>
    </section>

        <h2>The Rule of 72</h2>
        <p>A quick way to estimate how long it will take your money to double is the "Rule of 72":</p>
        <p>72 รท Interest Rate = Years to Double</p>
        <p>For example, at 8% interest, your money would double in approximately 9 years (72 รท 8 = 9).</p>

        <h2>Applying Compound Interest in Real Life</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Savings accounts:</strong> Look for high-yield savings accounts to maximize your returns.</li>
            <li><strong>Investments:</strong> Consider index funds or ETFs for long-term growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Retirement accounts:</strong> Take advantage of 401(k)s and IRAs to benefit from compound growth.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>The Flip Side: Compound Interest on Debt</h2>
        <p>Remember, compound interest can work against you with debt, especially credit cards. High-interest debt can grow rapidly, making it crucial to pay it off as quickly as possible.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Start early: Time is your greatest ally in compound interest.</li>
            <li>Be consistent: Regular contributions amplify the compound effect.</li>
            <li>Reinvest returns: Allow your earnings to generate more earnings.</li>
            <li>Choose wisely: Look for investments with competitive interest rates or returns.</li>
            <li>Be patient: The most significant growth often happens in later years.</li>
        </ul>
